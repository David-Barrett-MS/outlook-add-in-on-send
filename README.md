# Sample add-in showing two different OnSend event hook-ups

## Contoso Event ItemSend test.xml

This uses OnSend event (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/outlook-on-send-addins?tabs=windows)

## Contoso LaunchEvent OnMessageSend.xml

This uses OnMessageSend (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/onmessagesend-onappointmentsend-events)

## Implementation

The backend code for both manifests is the same, the only difference is in the way the send event is hooked up.
